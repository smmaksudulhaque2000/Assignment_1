CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a vital technology for web design that controls the visual presentation of HTML elements. By separating content from design, CSS allows developers to style and layout web pages with precision and flexibility. Through CSS, you can define colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, creating aesthetically pleasing and responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. CSS enhances user experience by ensuring consistency across web pages, facilitating maintainability, and enabling creative expressions in web development. Its continuous evolution, with features like CSS Grid and Flexbox, empowers developers to build sophisticated and modern web interfaces.
