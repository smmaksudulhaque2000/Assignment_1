HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of the web. It structures and organizes content on the internet, allowing browsers to display text, images, links, and other elements in a coherent and visually appealing way. As the backbone of web development, HTML is essential for creating web pages and applications, serving as the framework upon which CSS and JavaScript enhance styling and interactivity. Despite its simplicity, HTML is powerful and versatile, continuously evolving to support new technologies and standards, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience across devices and platforms.
