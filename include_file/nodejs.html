Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for building scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js is particularly valued for its ability to handle simultaneous connections and real-time applications, such as chat applications or streaming services. It's supported by a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, enabling developers to easily extend its capabilities for various purposes, from web servers to command-line tools and desktop applications. Node.js has revolutionized backend development by unifying frontend and backend development under a single language, JavaScript, simplifying the development stack and accelerating innovation in web technologies.
